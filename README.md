# language-server
### _by IAmRasputin <ryanmgannon@gmail.com>_

This is an implementation of Microsoft's Language Server Protocol for Common Lisp.

The goal is to allow editor-agnostic programming features, such as autocomplete,
goto definition, etc, while _also_ respecting Common Lisp's image-based programming
strengths (e.g. exposing a REPL).
